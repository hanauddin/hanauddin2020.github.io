                </div>
                <p>I am a third year student at Goldsmiths University, studying BSc Computer Science. In my spare time, I like to sketch fantasy style drawings. I also enjoy drawing animals; especially marine animals. This drawing beside is my lastest drawing - i don't draw as much as I used to since I am studying at university and have a part time job. However,with my remaining free time I take the opputunity to draw when i can. </p>
                
                <p>Apart from drawing, I enjoy travelling. I have been to several countries such as Bangladesh, Oman, Germany, UAE, USA, Canada, malaysia, Singapore, Spain,Turkey, Italy and Morroco. Out of all of the countries listed, Malaysia was my favourite country because they had the nicest food and it was my first time swimming in the ocean. Now, I aspire to travel to other countries like Indonesia, japan and Iceland.  </p>

                    <p>One of my favorite language to use. This is the main language I used within my second year of university. When starting it was one of the hardest languages for me to develop but with further research, I found that it was an enjoyable process of making applications using Java. An application that was made was a spell checker application and practicing algorithms such as the binary search tree.</p>

                    <p>HTML and CSS is one of the more enjoyable activity I like to participate. I enjoy making websites in my free time and improving on my CSS skills. This is because I find CSS to be the hardest as I find designing to be a long process. However, the more I practice my CSS skill I can see the drastic improvements in comparison to how I use to design my websites. </p>

I am learning from my current modules which are creative machine learning and understanding the basics of machine learning and how models are used to train the systems to identify and learn the different objects. From this, I was able to learn how I can make a game by using machine learning techniques I learned within my module. </p>
